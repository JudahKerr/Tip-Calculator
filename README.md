Used CSS Flexbox and Grid to get the layout.
Learned how to get icons on text inputs. 
Learned how to round numbers to 2 decimal places and which method is the most accurate.

The thing I struggled with the most was switching between the "clicked" classes on the buttons to show which was selected, and deselecting the others.
Finally got the logic right with the toggleClass function and a for loop!
